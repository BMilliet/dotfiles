## Container as dotfiles
this project is a work in progress.

## Guide

The main point of this setup is creating a portable dotfile structure that could be used in any OS that have a container tool (ex: podman, docker).
Each container contains the specified use like general dev tools plus text-editor (vim based) or just a text-editor and so on.

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BMilliet/dotfiles.git ~/.config/dotfiles
```
